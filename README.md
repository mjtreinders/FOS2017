# Focus of the course: *Molecular Epidemiology in Ageing research* #

The student will be taken into a natural sequence of issues that are
met in different disciplines of genetic/genomic research. Introduction
into genomics of complex disease: which research questions are of
importance in different disease fields, what common designs are
applied in genetic and gene expression studies, how and why are large
datasets of genetic, gene expression and phenotypic data collected,
what do the datatypes look like, how are such datasets managed, which
bioinformatic tools are used for pattern recognition in the data, to
match results with existing biological information, to form new
hypotheses

Literature and documents for study assignments will be handed out
during the course.

#### Evaluation ####

For individual evaluation of students, the module coordinators of the
first 2 weeks will judge the following: participation in the (paper)
discussions answers to the questions in the practicals

The module coordinators of the third week will judge the following
